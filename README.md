# Four-Queens

The program will attempt to determine when given an n by n array where n queens can be placed on the board without interfering with one another. The first attempt, done 4 years ago attempted to use a naive form of backtracking. It worked up until a 7 by 7. Eventually that version will be uploaded here. The version that I am trying to implement now will attempt to use a DFS approach for determining where the queens can possibly be placed.
