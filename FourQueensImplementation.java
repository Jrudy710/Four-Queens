* Four Queens

* This is the program that will attempt to solve the problem of where to place queens on an n by n board, 
* so that none of the queens have the possibility of colliding with each other. 
* This will be attempted by using a DFS approach, with the stack implementation that will be used in the form of an ArrayList.
* Once the queens that are on the board are equal to the size of the chessboard, given that it will be a square board, 
* the values will be returned to the user.
